# Haskell Tutorial

I wanted to fill a few pages with some of the Haskell knowledge I've gotten in the last few months.

Tutorial.lhs is valid literate Haskell, you can load it into ghci via

> ghci Tutorial.lhs

The colored version is not the same as the one in Tutorial.lhs, but it has a little more in it. It
is not literate Haskell.
